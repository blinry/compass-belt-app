- BBC micro:bit using ARM mbed DAPLink firmware

## Features

## Credits

The app uses the [usb-serial-for-android](https://github.com/mik3y/usb-serial-for-android) library.

## Motivation

I got various requests asking for help with Android development or source code for my
[Serial USB Terminal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.kai_morich.serial_usb_terminal) app.
Here you find a simplified version of my app.
